# Linear-Regression
Machine Learning project using linear regression (cost function, gradient descent)
The code has (cost func) to calculate the error of my output values, (Gradient descent func) changes the values of thetas to minimize the error rate. 
Te file (ex1data1) is the data set I worked on in the code I uploaded it if youo don't have data set to test your code, if you have one you just have to change the name of the file in the code to the name of your file.
